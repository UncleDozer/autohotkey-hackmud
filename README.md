#Intro
Just a few quick rebinds written for people wanting readline shortcuts.
Taking suggestions for any I may be missing.

##USAGE
###If you have autohotkey set up
Simply load this script before or after running hackmud.

###If you don't have autohotkey set up
You can run the compiled version (autohotkey-hackmud.exe) before or after running hackmud and it will automatically run the script, no setup required.

##Hotkeys
- Ctrl-w : Delete one word back
- Ctrl-x : Copy
